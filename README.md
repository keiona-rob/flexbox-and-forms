Part 1: Basic Flexbox Concepts
Create a Flexbox Container:

Create an index.html file.
Add a container <div> element and three child <div> elements inside it.
Apply a height, width, and background color to the three child <div>
Apply Flexbox properties to the container to arrange the child elements in a row.
Use Flexbox Properties:

Add CSS to style the Flexbox container and its child elements (e.g., gap, justify-content, align-items).
Part 2: Inline vs. Block Elements
Differentiate Inline and Block Elements:
In your index.html file, add examples of inline elements (<span>, <a>) and block elements (<div>, <p>).
Add CSS to style these elements differently (e.g., background color, margin).
Part 3: Advanced Form Techniques
Create a Form with Advanced Techniques:

Add a form to your index.html file with the following elements:
Text input with placeholder and autofocus
Email input with placeholder and required validation
Password input with placeholder and required validation
Submit button
Style the Form Using Flexbox:

Use Flexbox to create a complex layout for the form elements, such as multiple columns.
Enhance Accessibility with ARIA Tags:

Add appropriate ARIA tags to each form element to enhance accessibility.
